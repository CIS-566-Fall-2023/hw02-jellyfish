## (Optional) Extra Credit
- Add another part to your jellyfish. This can be something real (ex: crown jellyfish and lions mane jellyfish have some pretty crazy features that might be fun to recreate) or whatever zany alien jellyfish addition you can imagine!
- Refine one of the existing parts (ex: adding scalloped edges and dents/puckering to the bell of the jellyfish)
- Render your jellyfish (a good place to start is watching [part 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ph-7ZpN5oY) and [part 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCQPDf-bupY) of Entagma's Houdini in 5 Minutes series where they briefly cover rendering basics
- Add some flair to your scene by adding a background (ex: coral or rock formations)
## Submission

    - Please delete the assignment README text
