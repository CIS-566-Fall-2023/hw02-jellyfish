# Procedural Jellyfish
## Submission
    - A description of your project: I created the body and tentacles based on the tutorial. I used shortest distance mapping to get some veins on the body. I used bend and copy to create the organs. I added a force kind on the jellyfish hair along with vellum hair and vellum solver, and used scatter and group to grow the hair from the body and make sure they are attached.
    - A small video is attached in this repo.
