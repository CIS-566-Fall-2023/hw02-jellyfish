# Procedural Jellyfish

Extra Credit: Toon Style Stylized Rendering & Realistic Rendering

This assignment was my first big foray into Houdini's simulations and it was a tough but worthwhile endeavor. Initially creating the Bell was a straightforward but cool process. Same for the Arms but the vellum simulation took a lot of playing around (and simulation time), especially because I extended the animation so that the Jellyfish would float back down but that caused the arms to get bunched up in the bell because of the Jellyfish's momentum. Because of that, I had to animate the Jellyfish to move more slowly so that there wouldn't be such a quick change in momentum. I used the same process as the arms to create the tentacles and then used a similar process as the bell (by creating a line and bending it) to create the organs.

Once I had the jellyfish created, I set up two different rendering styles to see the Jellyfish in two different lights. One was a realistic PBR render and another was a toon-like shading.
