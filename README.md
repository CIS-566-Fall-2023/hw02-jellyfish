## Overview
For the bell, arms and tentacles, I basicly followed the tutorial videos. 
For the organs, I created a cube and then bended and twisted it, and used the smooth tool to get the target shape. Then I mirrored 1 organ to get 4.
Regarding the vein, it is weird that there is not a Find Shortest Path node on my Houdini, even after I removed the software and install it again, I still could not find it. Therefore, I tried some other methods, and at last I used the Group find path node to generate some random paths at the surface of the bell.
