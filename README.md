# Procedural Jellyfish
<a href="[https://www.google.com/](https://youtu.be/d2GTRQGMLEA)" target="_blank">Video Demo</a>

Created all in Houdini, this project seeks to recreate an animated jellyfish using procedural workflows.

For the Jellyfish, there were 5 main parts I created procedurally
- Bell shaped body
- Arms
- Veins
- Organs
- Hair

The animation was done by combining hand-keying and cloth simulation for the arms and hairs.
