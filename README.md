## Bell and Arms

![](./body.png)

The bell is created by revolving bent lines around one axis.

The arms are created by instancing an arm with rotation offset created from a plane, where noise function is used to add irregularity to the shape.

## Veins

For veins, the approach I used was a little different from the tutorial, although it was still generated by findShortestPath node. The difference was I used another mode that connected all start and end points with almost one path. I used two group nodes to select start points and end points.

## Organs

The organ is created using five curved cylinders. It animates with the bell.

## Tentacles

First, I selected the points at the bottom of the bell, then use copyToPoint to instantiate lines. The lines are attached to a hair solver.
