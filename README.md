# Submission: Thomas Shaw

For this project I tried to replicate the original images, but also mess around and see different ways of doing things in Houdini. The most useful thing I discovered was plugging untransformed objects into NULLs, then using both that NULL and a later one post-transformation to animate extra geometry on the surface of the original mesh. This could also be done using time shift nodes, but it really depends on the use case.

I definitely put way more time than I should have into organizing my node structure and naming things properly. But I think it pays off in the end for modifying things in post.

This was a super useful experience and one of my favorite homeworks so far!
