# Steps
## Bell
The bell is created from a line. Then I bend it to a curve and revolve it into a bell. Last, I added a mountain node to give it a little bit of variation. 

## Arms
The arms were created by twisting a ruffled surface around the y-axis. Then I use the vellumconstraints to pin the arms to the centroid of the bells and give it a cloth simulation. 

## Veins
First, I used two groups to define the start points and end points of the findshortestpath node by using bounding boxes to select the point on the bell. Then I used the findshortestpath node to create a path for any start point to each end point. Lastly, sweep the paths and pin them to the bells.

## Organs
The organs were generated by sweeping a hand draw bezier curve. Then, pin them to the bell.

## Tentacles
The tentacles were created by attaching a line for each point on the bottom of the bell. Then, add a hair simulation for the lines.
